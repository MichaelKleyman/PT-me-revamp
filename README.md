# Revamp

## TODO
- [x] Make the new routes/pages when logged in be authenticated routes
- [x] Choose which section to begin working on (Dashboard, Schedule, Patients)
- [x] Set up queries/mutations for whatever necessary operations are needed
- [] Create reusable helper function on the backend that will perform simple `getById` drizzle calls
